# Kidney-Stone-Detection-Using-Convolution-Neural-Networks
The effective management of kidney stones depends on a precise and prompt diagnosis of the issue. This research utilizes a Faster R-CNN object detection model that is enhanced with an attention mechanism for the identification of kidney stones and the evaluation of their dimensions. By concentrating
